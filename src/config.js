 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * Normally we probably wouldn't want our API Key to be out there in a public repo (or any repo, really)
 * The safest way of doing this would be using environmental variables -
 * For example, we could create a .env file with the API key that isn't committed into the repo etc.
 * But for the purposes of this test, this is probably okay.
